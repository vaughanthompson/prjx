        <section>

            <p>At the place all good brands start - by talking to our people and customers about what our brand means to them. Here's what they told us:</p>

            <ul class=" vanilla bulleted">
                <li>Our <strong>competitive advantage</strong> is more than just the world-leading products we sell and support. It's our amazing people and the work they do to tailor solutions to the things that matter to customers.
                </li>
                <li>Our size, our nationwide coverage, our understanding of Kiwi conditions and our end-to-end offering are also <strong>core strengths.</strong></li>
                <li>We're seen as a hard-working, down-to-earth, approachable and reliable brand. Customers love that we find ways to <strong>get the things they need done.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>But our people and customers also told us to evolve some of our past foundations and to get ready for a more sustainable world of alternative fuels, AI and other innovative technologies. </p>

            <h3>Local like you.</h3>
                <p>Our story started simple. Two Kiwi mates, with a passion for engines and a relentless drive to find the right solution and to do the best job for their customers. Over 40 years on, our team is nearly 300 strong and the machines are better, faster, and more high-tech. 
            </p>
            <p>But we've still got that same determination for all things mechanical, and working as a team to do right by our customers, no matter how hard the work is.
                It's an attitude that holds true when you're here at our place or down  at yours. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>Yes, we sell, service and support some of the world's best brands but down on the ground, it's local knowledge that really counts. Our people know local conditions and industries, and what matters to locals like you. After all, we're part  of the same communities you live and work in.
            </p>
            <p>Here's the thing: The world is moving fast and the products and services our customers expect from us are always changing. </p>
            <p>Our industry is about getting your hands dirty but now it's also about embracing technology, innovation and sustainability.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>We're embracing the changes, constantly upskilling our people and working with our global partners to lead the way in delivering the tailored solutions  our customers need.</p>

            <p>So here's our commitment to you: no matter what your world looks like next year, or in another 40 years, we'll still be right here, alongside you, delivering the superior sales and service experience you've come to expect. 
            </p>

            <h6>After all, we're locals just like you. So let's roll up our sleeves and work together to support you, and the communities we both call home.</h6>
