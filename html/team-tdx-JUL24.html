                        <br>

                        <h6>The PPD team, or Power Products Division, is one of the original groups within TDX - it was essentially what the original Transmission and Diesel Engines business was founded on and it's an important cog in the TDX wheel.</h6>
                        <br>

                        <h6>This month's introduction is from Sean Cole, who gave us a bit of insight into the team.</h6>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>I head up the Power Products Division, a team which has a focus on 'making stuff go' with the use of engines, transmissions, PTO's and generators.</p>
                     
                        <p>There are nine of us in the team including myself, between us all we have 160 years' worth of technical and sales expertise at TDX, there wouldn't be too many competitors out there with this experience.</p>

                       <p>We are quite unique within TDX, PPD look after sales, technical support and parts relevant to the PPD product range under our umbrella, the team all have multiple feathers in their hats and do a range of tasks.</p>

                        <p>Most team members are based in Auckland and one of the crew is at Head Office in Christchurch. We have three dedicated and passionate parts guys, one admin person with the remaining team consisting of both sales and technical / product support.</p>

                        <p>Like many areas of the business, we've noticed a bit of a softening in the market of late. There are still good enquiries coming through, but we're having to work a bit harder to get sales across the line.</p>

                       <h6 class="brandColor">One of the buzzwords in recent years is 'pivot,' it's fair to say we've been doing a bit of that as we look to keep all products ticking over.</h6>

                        <p>We've found a bit of a niche area in horticulture with several local OEM's. We work very closely with <a href="https://www.frostboss.com/why-fans" class="brandColor" target="_blank">NZ Frost Fans</a> to which TDX are now the sole supplier of Perkins engines. Robotics Plus with their autonomous machine powered by a Kohler KDI series Tier 4 final engine and another autonomous machine project for Cloudy Bay, they are also looking at using a Kohler KDI series Euro stage V engine.</p> 

                        <p>Another key OEM is <a href="https://www.trt.co.nz/" class="brandColor" target="_blank">TRT</a>, the New Zealand manufacturer and distributor of TIDD crane range which uses the <a href="https://www.tdxltd.co.nz/brands/allison-transmissions" class="brandColor" target="_blank">Allison</a> 3000 world series transmission.</p> 

                        <p>We're always looking for new ways to evolve and support new opportunities, that way we can continue to be one of the leading suppliers in New Zealand, a title the team are proud to have held for a number of years and look forward to continuing.</p>

                        <br>

                        <h6>Everyone dreams about driving a big digger at least once in their life, for a group of TDX customers their wish came true when they visited Sweden in early June to participate in the first Volvo Day since COVID. Here's a bit of what they got up to, as told by two of the TDX team who accompanied them on the trip.</h6>

                        <br>
                        
                        <p>Our TDX group included nine customers from sectors including quarry, mining, forestry, wood handling off the port and general contracting.</p>

                        <p>They were invited as they are key customers and are people we're looking to build long-term relationships with. They're also all users of Volvo products, so it was a fantastic opportunity to get them to the home of Volvo to witness firsthand what goes into making  the machines they use daily.</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>The programme was six days long, we landed in Stockholm and finished in Copenhagen. The visit included three factory tours, time at the Volvo Museum and also the Volvo Day itself.</p>
                        
                        <p>The factory visits were incredible, we spent time at the Axle and Transmission plant, Loader manufacturing and the Articulated Dump Truck factory.</p>

                        <p>The facts and figures associated with these facilities are hard to put into context, they are absolutely massive and are mind-blowing in terms of size and scale.</p>   
                                  
                        <p>For example, the factory at Braas where Volvo make the Artic Hauler has 940 employees spread over 60,000 square metres. One unit is produced every hour and it takes seven days to make it from start to finish.</p>

                        <p>As for the Volvo Museum, you know a brand must have been around for a long time doing something right when they have their own museum! It was a really interesting place to visit, generations of equipment were on display as were
                        items relating to the history of the brand.</p>


                        <p>One thing is clear, the team at Volvo are incredibly proud of their heritage, it's a brand with longevity - there are even some employees who are the third generation of a family working on the product.</p>

                        <p>And then there was the main event we'd all come for - the Volvo Day. It was a stadium set  up with a stage full of different products which were demonstrated to us, then the customers were able to go and experience whatever they wanted. A highlight was the Volvo EC950 Excavator.</p>   
                                  
                        <p>It was ideal travelling in a group of this size as everyone got the chance to get to know each other a bit and talk business. We also heard a few of their conversations about TDX, pleasingly they were all positive and assured our customers that they're dealing with a reputable business with trust and credibility at the heart of our values.</p>

                        <p> It was also important for them to see the strong relationship that exists between Volvo and TDX and, by extension, them as our customers.</p>

                        <p>As Trevor has covered off the trip itself, I thought I'd mention some other thoughts and
                        observations and how they can relate to TDX.</p>

                        <p>Sweden has a population of 10.5 million people, but being part of a relatively small country is no barrier to Volvo. Volvo CE has 16,000 employees with products sold in 180 markets. They are a major player on the world stage and are a household name, it's mind-blowing to appreciate how incredibly successful they are as a brand.</p>

                        <p>They have achieved this through a company culture of customer focus and inspiring dealers to feel part of the team who, in turn, become brand ambassadors.</p>

                        <p>Here in New Zealand there are 5 million people and TDX has about 300 employees and a
                        nationwide network of 18 branches.</p>

                        <p>Something we have in common with Volvo CE is pride and passion in what we do, our
                        business and how we relate to our customers. All of these qualities were evident every time we met a Volvo employee on our trip. They all have an obvious excitement and enthusiasm for what they do.</p>

                        <p>There is a genuine and positive attitude, you can feel it every step of the way and it instils confidence in the brand. This feeling flows through to when you're using the product, as you know there is a world-class team standing behind it.</p>

                        <p>This was on show at the Volvo Day, when we had the opportunity to speak with product
                        specialists, they're absolutely passionate about everything Volvo CE. The chance to experience some of the 75 machines firsthand also reinforced confidence in
                        the equipment.</p>

                        <p>While TDX mightn't be the biggest in the business, we certainly can be the best.
                        I believe if we follow our values and take learnings from the Volvo CE team, then we too can achieve excellence here in New Zealand and TDX can also become a household name.</p>

                        <h6 >The TDX Napier Branch has been around since 2017 and has weathered its fair share of storms, not least of which was Cyclone Gabrielle in February last year.</h6>  
                        
                        <h6>Dave Ashburn, Operations Manager - Lower North Island, has been watching progress and checked in with an update from the team.</h6>  
                        <br> 

                        <p>Napier was one of the places hardest hit by Cyclone Gabrielle at the start of last year, it smashed the region and caused loss of life as well as millions of dollars damage to infrastructure and business.</p>

                        <p>It had a significant and long-lasting impact on the community, our customers and our TDX team at the Napier Branch, which was shut for a week.</p> 
                    
                        <p>In the time that's followed, the Napier team has made some real strides in the recovery. It would have been really easy for them to say it's all too hard, we can't manage, the job's too big - but they've done the opposite.</p>

                        <p>What's even more impressive is that Napier is a young team, perhaps this youthfulness
                        contributes to the passion and enthusiasm about the place.</p>

                        <p>At the heart of every team is their leader, the tight knit TDX Napier Branch is fortunate to have Shona Jones as their go-to person.</p>

                        <p>It's this positive word-of-mouth in the community which can help make the difference not just keeping customers, but getting new ones. The team is making fantastic inroads with local customers, such as the Port and Chep pallets.</p>

                        <p>And Napier's results speak for themself, they're performing well and doing it consistently.</p>

                        <p>Napier is typically a busy branch with work often booked up two weeks in advance, they
                        average 136 jobs a month.</p>

                       <p>“The phrase that springs to mind when I try to describe Fieldays is 'like a kid in a candy store,' that's the wide-eyed look that many people have when they arrive at Fieldays for the first time,” said Nigel Davies, Regional Sales Manager Equipment Upper North Island.</p> 

                       <p>“The size and scale of the whole setup really needs to be seen to be believed, it's absolutely massive.</p>

                        <p>“Our TDX display took up three sites and featured a wide range of machines from our partners. All up, there were 26 different products on site consisting of 13x Yanmar, 2x Volvo electric, 5x Volvo and 4x Linde.</p>  

                       <h6 class="brandColor">“It's the perfect environment to showcase the machines and new technologies, as well as
                        discuss how various applications can be so useful for people.</h6>

                        <p>“Speaking of which, one of the great innovations on our site this year was a special Yanmar
                        display in the super competitive 1.7-tonne machine space. Richard Papps put together four
                        machines with different couplings as a way to demonstrate to show-goers the functionality of
                        each of the attachments. It made it really easy for people to see exactly what they get and
                        how it would operate.</p>

                        <p>“Above all else, it's the perfect environment to speak with literally thousands of people. You
                        can't put a value on the conversations you have, it's about establishing a relationship with
                        potential future customers.</p>                        
                       
                        <p>“There were definitely deals done at the event, but now is when a lot of the hard work starts -
                        following up on leads.</p>

                        <p>“We're fortunate to have the Sales Force system running at TDX, it provides a backend
                        process for qualifying enquiries and identifying hot leads. Due to sickness the order desk
                        team weren't able to be there in person, so a big thanks to Territory Managers for ensuring
                        all this important information was captured.</p>                        
                       
                        <p>“All in all, the four days went really well, we should be rightfully proud of what we achieved.
                        I'd like to acknowledge the team involved with the event, from planning to participating and
                        pulling it all down at the end.</p>

                        <p>“TDX has been a regular at Fieldays over the past 25 years,” said Marc Warr, Marketing Manager.</p>                        
                       
                        <p>“This total size of our site was 33m x 32m, which included a 15m x 10m marquee. Inside the tent we showcased the Volvo electric compact machines, Toitu, Dafo, TX tracks, Volvo Breakers as well as the wide range of consumables products we offer.</p>

                        <p>“As a way to help encourage people to come inside and view our display, we had a couple of carrots dangling out the front to entice people onto our stand.</p>                        
                       
                        <p>“These included the Volvo 'Little Diggers Sandpit' and a Shell racing simulator. They were a hit with the kids and it kept them busy, which then allowed their parents the chance to wander about our display uninterrupted. But there were a number of tears from more than a few of the youngsters when it was time to leave, as they were having too much fun.</p>

                        <p>“All of our key competitors were on sites around us, so there was a real need to make the TDX stand appealing and memorable.</p>

                        <br>
                        
                        <h6>Scott Tomkies, the Allison Transmission Business Manager, has been involved with PTO sales at TDX for 15 years and last year achieved an impressive 'first' - one million dollars plus of sales in the last financial year.</h6>

                        <hr>
                        <br>

                        <p>“Scott's a proven Million Dollar PTO Master,” said his manager, Sean Cole.</p>

                        <p>“What he doesn't know about PTO's probably isn't worth knowing.”</p>

                        <p>For those who don't know what a PTO is, it's a mechanical drive which allows power to be
                        drawn from an Allison or manual transmission to operate hydraulics whilst the truck is
                        running. Essentially it provides hydraulic power for an external attachment or function such
                        as a rubbish truck to lift and empty bins.</p>

                        <p>“Impressively, Scotty supplied and fitted approximately 440 PTO's into the market last year,” said Sean.</p>

                        <p>“That's a lot of product in anyone's language, an average of 1.7 units each day with a fitment time of 3-4 hours per unit.”</p>

                        <p>It's taken a huge amount of initiative to get that many PTO's into the market.</p>

                       <p>“Scott has displayed impressive levels of innovation and is very passionate about what he
                       does, he's developed an idea and tailored an offer to meet the market,” said Sean.</p>

                       <p>“He has then managed the business opportunity and turned it into something spectacular, so
                       much so that TDX is the Number One supplier of PTO's in New Zealand by far.</p>

                       <p>“It's really exciting to see something like this pay big dividends and Scott should feel really
                       proud of what he's achieved, both for himself and for TDX.”</p>
