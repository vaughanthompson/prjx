                        <h6 class="">In this month's introduction, Directors Steve Wooff and Alister McLaughlin share some of their memories about Lee Jenkins as she retires from TDX.</h6>
                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        <br>

                        <p>When Lee Jenkins first started working with the then Transmission &amp; Diesels Ltd on a part-time basis doing 'a bit of bookkeeping for a fledgling business,' no one would have thought she'd still be there almost 40 years later.</p>

                        <p>“Thankfully she stuck with us, as without Lee things could have been incredibly different,” said Steve.</p>

                        <p>“She's been the glue that has held everything together through some very challenging times, she's been the cog that has kept things turning, she's also been a dedicated and loyal employee - but, above all else, an incredible friend to myself and so many in the TDX family.”</p>

                        <p>In early 1983, Lee was recommended to Steve and Alister by Norm Bland, Transmissions and Diesels Customs Broker, who suggested their new business could do with some help to 'get things in order.'<br>
                            “Lee was a great fit, she knew what was required and was able to take care not just of the book keeping side of things, but also anything and everything else that was thrown at her, which allowed us to focus on rebuilding engines,” said Steve.
                            </p>

                        <h3 class="green">“She quickly became a critical part of the early TDX operation and transitioned to a full-time role.  She rose to the challenge and evolved into a multi-skilled and incredibly competent operator,” said Steve.</h3>
                   
                        <p>“Let's be honest,” added Alister.</p>

                        <p>“We were floundering from an administrative perspective, we needed someone to help with that side of things and with Lee, we clicked immediately, and the original part-time job turned into a 40-year long career.”</p>

                        <p>Steve continued: “In those formative years of the business, we all shared complementary skills which developed into a great partnership.  We had a great team and it started to grow from there. Lee was able to forge excellent personal relationships with people we were dealing with, she developed trust and credibility which meant banks and Financiers felt reassured engaging with TDX.”</p>

                        <p>Both Directors agree Lee is a lady of many talents and has an incredible ability to relate to people from all walks of life and across all business functions.</p>

                        <p>“She has been amazing to watch discussing complex financial arrangements and negotiations.  She has been recognised by banks and consultants for her skill and expertise, as well as meticulous attention to detail,” said Steve.<br>
                        “She has a unique ability to define what's important, then develop solutions for the most difficult of challenges.”</p>

                        <p>When asked to recount a specific memory or story about Lee, both men hesitate and take a minute to think about a specific time in the last 40 years.<br>
                        “As well as being a business whiz, Lee is very much a people person, I think she's been to every social club event and is often the last one to leave.  She has an interest in all the team and takes time to help anyone who needs it.  These are very special and rare qualities,” said Steve.</p>

                        <p>One specific memory for Alister, which proved to be an important moment in the formative years of the business, was the introduction of GST in 1986.</p>

                        <p>“Lee was instrumental in stock taking, accounting for and submitting a rebate for 'goods in stock' to the Government.</p>

                        <p>“It was a huge amount of work going through all of the items we had sitting around in the warehouse, scattered through the storeroom and lying about in various states of repair.<br>
                        “Lee's dedication and attention to detail resulted in TDX receiving a $100,000 rebate, which in those days was a significant amount of money for our three-year-old business and certainly helped our rather challenging cash flow situation.</p>

                        <p>“When the rebate arrived in our account, it eased a few sleepless nights and enabled myself and the team to focus on what we were good at - the operational, customer-focused side of the business.”</p>

                        <p>Both Steve and Alister were very adamant about one key consideration relating to Lee and her time at TDX.</p>

                        <p>“We'd like to acknowledge Lee as being an integral part in the TDX story.  We simply could not have built TDX without Lee.  Both of us recognise that if it wasn't for her, TDX wouldn't be the business it is today.</p>

                        <p>“It's not quite goodbye yet for Lee as she will remain our board secretary and as a shareholder will retain a keen interest in the future of TDX.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="">“As a final word Lee - thank you for 40 years of hard grind and for your unfaltering dedication.”</h4>

                        <p>Well, I'm into my last weeks in my role as Financial Controller of TDX and the Terrequipe Group finishing at the end of July, although I will be continuing as Company Secretary which entails 2-3 days a month, so will still remain part of the business.</p>

                        <hr><br>
                        
                        <p>In 2018 Mike McKessar, our then-CEO asked me what my plans were for the future and I replied that I had 3-5 years left in me yet as long as my health was okay, and suddenly last year I was looming up to the five-year point and made the decision to retire from my full-time position. </p>

                        <p> Oh my god what a journey, I am now in my 40th year and have loved every minute of it, had a huge amount of fun and laughter along the way, I honestly don't know where the years have gone.

                        <p>There have been so many milestones over my time with the company but the major one and most challenging was becoming the NZ distributor for Volvo and Yanmar with the purchase of Titan Plant Services business assets where we doubled our sales and EBIT in the first year.  At the same time Dave Wooff, one of our founding shareholders, was exiting the business, we were raising additional capital from new shareholders, and establishing additional funding lines, so I was immersed in various legal documentation which was a huge learning curve for me and was very rewarding.  I was also very privileged to be offered a shareholding in the company which I was only too happy to accept. </p>

                        <p>For me personally, it has been the challenge and being part of the team in growing the business to where it is today.  I have loved working with Alister, Steve, Dave and Mike over the years, the Board, ELT, SLT and everybody else across the business.  We have an amazing group of employees who not only have a passion for our products but also for the company with whom I have been lucky enough to form so many long-lasting friendships.</p>

                        <p>Everybody has an important part to play within the company, we all need the support of each other to be successful as a company no matter what division you work for.</p>

                        <h3 class="">“TDX has partnered with Toitū, an organisation which helps businesses as they start out on their carbon measurement and decarbonisation journey,” said Alle.</h3>

                        <p>“Toitū will assist us in setting up our company baseline by first measuring our carbon emissions.  The next step will see us setting targets and actions to reduce our overall carbon footprint. Now that our first audit is behind us, we know our current footprint.  In terms of visualising it, think of 10,500 hot air balloons floating above the Canterbury Plains on a crisp winter morning - thats a lot of emissions our business is directly responsible for.”</p>

                        <p>As part of the road to reduction, TDX will develop a plan which captures opportunities for lessening carbon emissions. “This is where the rubber meets the road, as the plan will shape the future direction of where we head to as a sustainable business,” said Alle.</p>

                        <p>Following the recent TDX and Toitu announcement, Alle is finding that sustainability is catching the imagination of many employees.</p>

                        <p>“Both Vee and I have had people approach us with ideas of ways we can all contribute to carbon reduction.  Its obviously a subject that is really important to many of us and something we want to be better at.</p>

                        <p>“Its created some great thinking and well look to implement some of the ideas as part of the plan to balance our emissions equation. There are some low-hanging fruit which we can grab and create some quick wins, but its also about the longer term and what we can do to be better into the future.”</p>

                        <p>In addition to environmental considerations, being part of the programme will have positive spinoffs from both a staff and customer perspective.</p>

                        <p>“Being part of an emissions reduction programme is a great way to retain staff and also attract new talent to the business.  If a potential employee had to decide between taking a job at Company A or Company B, were confident they'd likely sway towards the one taking action in the climate care space."</p>


                        <p>“I believe it positions TDX well in a tight market as were walking the walk when it comes to sustainability actions. Its also a powerful statement for our current customers and is also a lever for bringing new customers on board."</p>

                        
                        <h4 class="">“Above all else, were doing the right thing.  Im thrilled to be part of the journey and am excited to see what we achieve in this space.”</h4>

                        <p>Boost is a web-based application that features more than 50 different businesses, all of which provide users with an exclusive special offer - and all offers are available to TDX employees.</p>

                        <p>“The idea for TDX to partner with Boost grew from a desire to recognise and reward people for being part of the TDX family,” said Steve Blanken, Infrastructure Manager.<br>
                        “The cost of joining the programme, as well as annual cost per employee, is covered by TDX.  Its a membership rewards programme which provides you with all the benefits, but without having to do anything to get them - apart from work at TDX.”</p>

                        <p>A quick check of the <a href="https://www.myboost.co.nz/" target="_blank" class="green">Boost</a> site reveals a wide range of different brand partners and benefits.</p>

                        <p>“Theres something there to appeal to everyone, ranging from discounts at Torpedo7, subsidised gym memberships - plus a special deal to enjoy at Dunkin Donuts after a workout,” said Steve.<br>
                        “Its a great way for TDX to deliver added benefits for all of our employees and really encourage people to get online and start making real savings on everyday items as well as special purchases.”</p>

                        <p>  According to Warren Peffer (Operations Manager - Upper North Island) and Jason Steele (Business Manager for Shell Lubricants in Auckland), there is a very deserving TDX employee being recognised as the 'Hero a Staff Member' for this month.</p>
                        <p>“Leon Procter has been with TDX almost 10 years and is the Parts Warehouse Manager for the TDX Auckland Wiri branch.  He only recently took over the role but is already starting to make a fantastic difference to the operation,” said Warren.</p>

                        <p>“He uses his initiative and develops opportunities which benefit the business.  For example, the work he has done in the yard has streamlined the operation and it is so much easier to find stock items. This pays for itself time and time again, it's now more orderly and systematic, which means faster delivery times to our customers. He is an incredibly likeable guy and is a great leader for his team of 15 yard and front counter staff.”</p>
                        <p>Jason had similar complimentary things to say.</p>
                        <p>“Leon displays a level of maturity which is inspiring.  He's a relationship builder and has created a great environment and rapport with his team. No job is ever too big.  He is calm under pressure, rises to the challenge and has a 'can do' attitude to get things done.  He has developed a reputation across the business as a go-to person to help solve difficult situations.</p>
                        <p>“Leon has been instrumental assisting some major customers with incredibly tight deadlines, all of which have resulted in positive outcomes.  Things could have been very different without his involvement and awesome attitude.</p>
                        <p>“We'd like to recognise Leon as a young man who is wise beyond his years and for helping to make a significant contribution to the success of TDX and our customers.  He is the type of guy who is the future of the business.”</p>
