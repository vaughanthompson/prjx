                        <br>

                        <h6>Introduction by Sean Cole, Power Products Manager</h6>
                        <br>

                        <p>If you've been wondering how things are tracking in the Power Products corner of TDX - the answer is: really well.  Like, really well.</p>
                        <p>While some areas of the business are navigating a few bumps in the road this year, Power Products is charging ahead, beating budget and keeping the momentum strong.  It's a solid reminder that success in one part of the business can help lift us all - and right now, PPD are doing some of the heavy lifting.</p>
                        
                        <br>
                        <h5 class="brandColor">Exclusive Win: NZ Frost Fan Chooses TDX (Perkins)</h5>
                        
                        <p>A major highlight this year? At the start of 2025, TDX Power Products became the exclusive engine supplier to NZ Frost Fan (NZFF) - a huge milestone for the team and a big deal for the business overall.</p>

                        <p>NZFF isn't just any customer - they're one of our largest.  They've been working with TDX since 2009, and now we've taken the next big step in that relationship.  Taking over from a co-supplier like John Deere is no small feat, and it speaks volumes about the trust we've built and the value we offer.</p>


                        <p>This partnership means 600-700 units per year, with exciting potential for more growth ahead.  NZFF is proudly Kiwi-owned, based in Hastings with operations in Blenheim and Australia, and they sell their frost fans globally through a distributor network.</p>

                        <h5 class="brandColor">Market Update: Winning in a Down Year</h5>
                        <br>
                        <p>Let's talk about the wider engine market.  At the end of Q1 2025, the industrial diesel engine market is down 30%.  Not great news in general - but here's the kicker: TDX's market share has jumped from 35% in Q1 last year to 51% this year.</p>
                        <p>Yes, you read that right. In a shrinking market, we're growing our slice of the pie. And with 16 years at the top, we're not slowing down anytime soon.</p>
                        <p>Things in the Industrial Generator area have been a little slow.  The overall market is down 22% for Q1, but thanks to our Kohler and Tx product, TDX has increased market share from 10.3% this time last year to 20% this year.</p>
                        <p>In the Marine Generator space with our Kohler product, the overall market is up for Q1.  TDX has an impressive 89% share and is maintaining the Number One spot, a position we have held for six years straight.</p>
                        <p>Allison remains the transmission of choice across a range of truck OEM's, from Hyundai to large Kenworth trucks plus a number of other OEM brands. This has brought increased parts sales across the country.</p>

                        <p>How are we doing it? A combination of top-tier products, unbeatable aftersales support via our highly experienced parts team, technical team and (most importantly) strong relationships built on trust, reliability, and knowing our customers inside out.  That's the TDX difference.</p> 
                        <p>There are also some exciting new products and opportunities for us to look forward to.  These include Allison re-gear for the NZ Rural Fire Service - with the potential for a number of others - as well as the Kohler KDI35404TCR Power Pack.  This is an impressive Stage Five emission compliant engine for a project at the Cloudy Bay Winery, which is one of the first in the Southern Hemisphere.  So watch this space, we'll report back on how it goes at a later time.</p> 
                        <p>To the Power Products Team and TDX - Take a bow!</p> 
                        <p>To everyone involved in these wins - thank you.  Whether you're behind the scenes or on the frontline with customers, it's your hard work that's keeping the engine running (pun intended).</p>

                        <br>

                        <h6>Richard Papps, Mike McKessar and Joe Gradwell recently returned from the Yanmar AOLA Dealer Meeting in Japan - and TDX didn't just show up, we punched above our weight on the regional stage.</h6><br>

                        <p>Over a two-day event with 30+ participants from across Asia, Oceania, and Latin America  (AOLA), Richard, Mike and Joe joined other Yanmar representatives from 12 markets for an incredible mix of collaboration, factory insights and recognition.</p>

                        <p>Day one included a tour of Yanmar's construction equipment factory (not many outsiders get to see the build process up close), followed by dealer presentations and success stories.</p>

                        <p>Here's where things got really exciting: TDX was handpicked by Yanmar to present one of only six dealer success stories across AOLA.  Richard and Joe showcased TDX's work on fixed-price servicing and text alert systems - initiatives that earned us First Place in Aftersales.</p>

                        <p>We were also honoured with the Sustained Growth Award at the formal sales awards, recognising consistent performance and market share gains over the past 2-3 years, made even more impressive considering the challenging market conditions we're experiencing in New Zealand.</p>
                        <p>For example, our market share in 2022 was 21%, in 2023 this grew to 22.5% and last year was 26%.  Year to date, we're tracking at 28%.</p>
                        <p>This is an impressive result compared with many of the other AOLA countries, in Australia they're running around 10% share.</p>

                        <p>Since our partnership with Yanmar began in 2011, we've steadily grown into a top-tier distributor in the region.  The last five years especially have pushed us into the early and mid-20s in market share and now, we're climbing even higher.</p>

                        <p>These awards are a reflection of everyone's work—across sales, aftersales, and support - it really is a company wide achievement. Small wins really do lead to great results, and these recognitions are proof that what we're doing matters.</p>

                        <br>       

                        <h6>It can be a big ask getting a team of people to live away from home for an extended time and commit to what can be a challenging work roster - often in harsh conditions.<br><br> 

                        But that's what a crew from TDX has been doing over the last year, and it's certainly been paying dividends for the relationship with Bathurst Mining at their Stockton mine site.  We had a chat with Scott Moodie to find out more about what's been going on.</h6>  
                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        <br>

                        <p>Over the past year, TDX has built a strong and productive relationship with BT Mining at the Stockton site near Westport, thanks to a dedicated crew and a solid OEM support model that's proving its value in the field.</p>
                        <p>TDX is on-site as the OEM for BT Mining's fleet of Volvo excavators and articulated haulers, operating on a 4x shift rotation—one week of days, followed by a week of nights.  The team lives locally in Westport during their shifts, bringing strong regional knowledge and capability to the site.</p>

                        <p>Our on-site crew of technicians includes Sam Burges from Invercargill, plus Nigel Maxwell, Ryan Van Den Burg and Lloyd George who are all from Nelson.</p>
                        <p>Together, they work under the coordination of our Greymouth branch, which remains a key part of the West Coast operations.  The Greymouth team manages shift changes, supports with parts procurement and keeps the lines of communication strong with BT Mining.</p>

                        
                        <br>
                        <h5 class="brandColor">Working with BT Mining</h5><br>

                        <p>BT Mining's Stockton operation is a full-scale, 24/7 open-cut coal mine, and they rely heavily on their Volvo equipment to maintain productivity.  Warwick Knox (BT Mining - Mobile Plant Manager) and Dave Craddock (Workshop Superintendent) are our main on-site contacts, with regular support and monthly catch-ups led by Dan Watson, Greymouth Service Manager.</p>

                        <p>All parts are ordered through BT Mining's procurement team and delivered via TDX Greymouth, with a dedicated point of contact managing parts needs.  This process ensures quick turnarounds and minimises machine downtime - a critical factor in such an isolated, high-pressure environment.</p>


                        <br>
                        <h5 class="brandColor">Valuable On-Site Experience</h5><br>


                        <p>For our TDX technicians, the site is more than just a job, it's a valuable learning opportunity. The team is gaining hands-on experience with large-scale mining equipment, including:</p>


                        <ul class="vanilla bulleted">
                            <li>Volvo A60 articulated haulers</li>
                            <li>EC380 and EC480 excavators</li>
                            <li>Cat 777s</li>
                            <li>Hitachi EX1900 excavators</li>
                            <li>Dozers and drilling equipment</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>This kind of exposure is rare in New Zealand and offers the same level of learning many would typically have to go to Australia to get.  It's a tough environment—think rain, heat, and even snow, but it's one that's expanding our team's skills and confidence.</p>

                        <p>With OEM support on site, BT Mining has seen a noticeable improvement in machine uptime.  Having our team on hand has helped reduce unplanned downtime, streamline service work and ensure equipment performance stays high - day and night.  Our regular track inspections and CSR input also give BT informed data to make smart decisions around servicing and procurement.</p>

                        <br>
                        <h5 class="brandColor">A Team Effort</h5><br>

                        <p>This operation shows how strong coordination between regions can make a real impact.  Having Invercargill and Nelson-based techs dedicated to the Stockton crew also frees up the West Coast team for wider regional support.  It's a great example of how we work together to support customers, grow capability and extend TDX's OEM excellence into the field.</p>

                        <p>We want to give a special shoutout to the Stockton crew, your commitment, adaptability, and professionalism in a challenging environment hasn't gone unnoticed.  You're not just keeping machines moving, you're helping TDX build stronger relationships and a better reputation every day.</p>

                        <br>       

                        <h6>How Adam and the Finance Team turn 'what if' into 'can do'</h6>  
                        <hr>
                        <br> 

                        <p>If you've ever wondered how we get machines into the hands of so many different customers, a large vote of thanks is due to the work done by Adam and the Finance & Leasing team working collectively with the sales and workshop teams.</p>
                        <p>Through financing, we are able to take a complex situation, work some magic with the numbers and make the seemingly impossible happen - all the while ensuring appropriate checks and balances are in place and the proposition is in the best possible interest for both TDX and our customers.</p>
                        <p>Adam heads up our Finance and Leasing division, and his job in theory is simple: help the sales team move  machines to their new homes.  But as we all know, nothing about selling heavy equipment is ever that straight forward.</p>
                        
                       <p>Finance is a big deal at TDX - we're currently sitting on a $40 million loan book, with 500 active loans on the go.  Around 30% of all new machines go out with finance, it's a critical part of our sales process and often the key that turns a “maybe” into a “let's do it.”</p>

                        <p>But it's not just about the numbers.  Finance can help smooth out the sales process and can remove some financial hurdles that can cause a roadblock for a customer. </p> 
                        <p>So, what's in it for customers?</p>   

 
                        <ul class="bulleted vanilla">
                            <li>Improved cash flow, thanks to flexible repayment options</li>
                            <li>Competitive rates (often better than what's on the market)</li>
                            <li>One point of contact — easy to deal with TDX from start to finish</li>
                            <li>Even the ability to finance repairs or non-TDX gear such as vehicles and trucks, which helps keep those relationships strong</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>It also helps that Adam loves what he does.  “The best part is seeing a customer get into a machine they didn't think was possible,” he says.  “Watching them grow from their first to their fifth machine - that's a win.”</p>

                        <p>And right now? It's go-time.  With the government's new additional 20% asset depreciation incentive announced at the end of May, more customers are reinvesting in their businesses - including buying new equipment. That's where we come in.</p>
                        <p>To sweeten the deal, the team has a finance promo running now - customers can take delivery immediately and defer payments until September.  It's perfectly timed for spring workloads and builds on the buzz leading into Mystery Creek Fieldays.</p>
                        <p>Fieldays is one of our biggest marketing activations of the year - a chance to meet customers from across the country and do what we do best: help them get into the right gear, with the right support, and the right finance behind it.</p>
                        <p>Keep an eye out for Adam and the team at Fieldays - they'll be right in the middle of the action, doing deals and helping customers take the next step in their business journey.</p>

                        <h1 class="">Hero Staff Member:<br>Andrew Gemmell - Our Man on the Ground in Hautapu</h1>
                        <br>
                        
                        <h6>As relayed by Joe Gradwell General Manager - Aftersales Operations, CHC</h6>
                        
                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        <br>

                        <p>If you've spent any time around the TDX team over the last few years or have dealt with the new LDX operation recently, chances are you've crossed paths with Andrew Gemmell - and, if you haven't, you've definitely seen the impact of his work.</p>
                        <p>Andrew has been with the business for four years now, with time spent across both TDX and LDX.  After a successful stint as the TDX Hamilton Service Manager, he stepped into the role of LDX North Island Service Manager about six months ago.  It's a role that feels like a perfect fit, especially given his deep roots in the materials handling and forklift world.</p>
                        <p>One of Andrew's standout contributions has been the development of the TDX Hautapu site.  He was absolutely key in getting it up and running, bringing not just technical know-how but also calm, practical leadership.  Like any new site, there were a few bumps in the road, but Andrew's steady hand, quick thinking and solutions-first mindset kept things moving smoothly.  He's known around the business as a 'solutions guy' - the person you go to when you need something fixed fast and fixed right.</p>

                        <p>Given the importance of the Hautapu site - especially with so much equipment going through the PD process - Andrew's expertise has helped shape a high-performing, efficient system that keeps everything flowing.  But it's not just about systems and processes.  Andrew's a people person through and through.  He works closely with teams across the business, he is well respected by his team and he's built strong relationships with key stakeholders and customers alike.</p>

                        <p>Whether it's jumping in a truck, visiting a customer site, or working shoulder-to-shoulder with his team to solve a problem, Andrew leads from the front.  His hands-on style and can-do attitude have made him an indispensable part of the operation. Just ask Fonterra — he's played a huge part in that relationship, acting as the go-to guy on the ground to keep things running smoothly.</p>

                       <br>
                       <br>

                        <p>Above all, Andrew is a team player.  He treats the business like it's his own, and he lives out TDX's values every day—especially when it comes to putting the customer first.</p>

                        <p>Joe put it best: “Andrew makes a huge contribution every single day. He's all-in when it comes to managing and supporting the Hamilton site, and his positive attitude is something we're all better for.  He's a great man to have around.”</p>
