                            <p>If you have something you would like featured in the newsletter, please get in touch with your manager and ask them to let Marc Warr <a href="mailto:marc.warr@tdxltd.co.nz" class="green">marc.warr@tdxltd.co.nz</a>  know about it, that way it can be considered for future issues.</p>

                            <p>In the meantime, let's get started on the latest edition.  This month's intro is from Andrew Falloon, who will provide an update about the business and how we have performed in the first quarter of the new year.</p>

                        <h6>Introduction by Andrew Falloon</h6>
                        <br>

                        <p>Hi team, before I get into things, I'd like to acknowledge the challenges that we have faced in the business over recent months.  There have been some key personnel changes, the economic climate has been up and down and various financial indicators have been a bit all over the place.</p>
                        <p>I admire the resilience and dedication of our team to getting the job done and helping our customers every step of the way.  We should all be rightfully proud of ourselves and each other, thank you all for your efforts.</p>
                        <p>Even with these challenges, TDX finished the first quarter in a reasonably strong position, finishing with #1 market share for the opening three months of the year with 104 units sold across our brand portfolio.</p>

                        <h6 class="brandColor">We're showing real strength in the mini-market, specifically with our Yanmar range of product, which is being well received amongst owner operators.</h6>
                        <br>
                        <p>There are some potential headwinds in the Volvo space, relating to pricing actions taken by some of our competitors offloading discounted old models on runout.  We continue to be challenged in the Volvo range, with challenges in the exchange rate, and some of our competitors inventory levels, making it harder to compete with some of the other brands, especially in the excavator space.</p>
                        <p>We can counter this by reinforcing the Unique Selling Proposition that Volvo machines offer, including Total Cost of Ownership benefits, combined with the advantage of having TDX as a supplier - both from a sales, service and parts supply perspective.  </p>
                        <p>If we continue playing to our strengths, then we can continue our winning ways.  And that includes us working harder than ever to protect our traditional customers as well as introducing new ones to the TDX family.</p>
                        <p>As I mentioned earlier, there have been some recent staffing changes.  To help navigate some of the current pressures, we are working on revised structures which should assist in the short term and set us up for what promises to be exciting months ahead, with a lot changing in the Volvo world both in terms of product launches and machine evolution.</p>
                        
                        

                        <p> For example, we'll soon be moving from the G-Series to J-Series Hauler, we will be introducing training opportunities for the new product.  Over the next three months we will be working hard on running out our older D and E-Series Excavators, in preparation for the arrival of the new and exciting F-Series.  Then, towards the end of the year, some new K-Series mid-to-large wheel loaders will be arriving, replacing some of the H series range. </p>

                        <p>Managing our inventory and these launches will be critical to our success. We are also launching a new SV86-7 in the Yanmar range, which promises to cement us further as the most popular compact excavator brand in the NZ market.</p>  
                        
                     
                        <p>In terms of new business, we recently signed up our first electric JL120 to Fulton Hogan in Auckland, this is a real milestone achievement for TDX as this machine is a real pillar for the brand and will be key to unlocking future success. This is reportedly a world first under this new rental commercial model.</p> 

                        <p>TDX and our brand partners were excited to be part of <a href="https://www.wheelsatwanaka.co.nz" target="_blank" class="green">Wheels at Wanaka</a>  over Easter weekend, it was an outstanding opportunity to connect the industry with the public.  We showcased a timeline of our history and positioned future product alongside, It was quite the sight having a L120C Volvo Wheel Loader from the early 1990's next to a new electric L120.  We were also able to do a number of live demonstrations, which were an absolute hit with the crowd of over 65,000 people.</p> 

                        <p>Shortly we will be attending the <a href="https://brisbanetruckshow.com.au" target="_blank" class="green">Brisbane Truck Show</a> (May 15-18) and TDX will also have a presence at the <a href="https://www.quarrynz.com" target="_blank" class="green">Quarry NZ Conference</a> (July 9-11).  These are both great events to fly the TDX flag, showcasing our partner's product and reminding people why they should have TDX at the top of their list when it comes to construction machinery and heavy equipment.</p> 

                        <br>
                        <h6 class="brandColor">Thanks again for your support and efforts making TDX the place it is today, it will be a busy year with plenty of new things to get involved with, so keep an eye out for some more updates coming through soon.</h6>

                        <br>

                        <h6>There's nothing smarter than getting advancements in technology to help us with our business.  Vinuri Lugoda and Craig Wymer, together with some members of the wider TDX team, have been working on an innovative project which is designed to enhance the level of service engagement on Yanmar machines.
                        </h6><br>

                        <p>“The Yanmar Service Reminder project runs out of Salesforce with a plug-in called 'TxTinIT' (SMS messaging service) which proactively sends an automatic text message to customers with Yanmar product, letting them know that their machine has reached a certain number of hours and is due for a service,” said Vinuri.</p>

                        <p>“The customer can then respond, either booking a service or requesting a parts kit.  Depending on their response, a central admin team member then books a service or assigns the job to the parts team.</p>

                        <p>“We have run a pilot programme with some customers in the lower South Island and received favourable feedback, so are about to introduce it nationwide.</p>

                        <p>“The service will go live on June 1 and enable Yanmar Smart Assist, meaning we can establish two-way communication with almost 1,000 Yanmar machines around the country.</p>

                        <p>“Over time, we will expand the service to non-Smart Assist machines as well, plus Volvo machines which already have an integrated telematics system.</p>
                        <p>“It's a proactive approach which helps operators take the guesswork out of machine maintenance, ensuring their machines are maintained in the best condition and using the best parts available.</p>
                        <p>“We anticipate it will be a welcome level of service which we can offer our customers as it makes their lives easier and enhances their overall experience with TDX.”</p>
                        <p>In addition to ensuring that their machines are serviced as required, there are also associated benefits for TDX.</p>

                        <p>“This will obviously benefit our bottom line, but also ensure machines in the field are in tip-top operating condition.”</p>

                        <h6>TDX has a strong presence in the south of the Mainland, with more than 15 employees stationed at branches in Invercargill, Dunedin and Cromwell.<br><br>

                            The team has been experiencing some good wins with Yanmar product and, according to Territory Manager of the Equipment Division, Mark Hopwood, it's developed a really strong following.<br><br>
                            
                            They have got some Yanmar machines into a major player in the hire equipment scene, a business called I-Hire, so we had a chat with Mark to find out more about what's been going on.

                        <p>Richard and other members of the TDX team have established a close relationship with the I-Hire crew.  When I-Hire first started they didn't run any of our products, it was a long, slow burn but now they have seven different Yanmar models on their books.</p>
                        <p>The machines come with a proven reputation and, as I-Hire have found out, they are dependable as well as reliable, all of which contributes to a low total cost of ownership.</p>
                        <p>In a business when time off the tools costs money, these machines have very little downtime and are out there doing the business day after day.</p>
                        <p>Key to success is the relationship between I-Hire and TDX.  We know what they want and need, they know they can trust us and Yanmar to get things done right the first time.</p>
                 
                      <p>One of the other added benefits of having our product in a rental business is a great opportunity for many different people to experience just how good the Yanmar product is.</p>

                        <h6>Here in New Zealand, the End of the Financial Year (EOFY) is March 31.  It's an important date for businesses as it's the deadline to finalise our financial year-end and set the stage for the next financial year.  It is also an opportunity to tidy up any loose ends and have the business ship-shape to move into a new financial year.  In our business, both the TDX and LDX Aftersales teams were heavily involved in closing off the EOFY, here's an update about their recent work.

                        <p>“It was important to get a good jump on the work involved and start to get the jobs ready to be processed to stay ahead of the eightball so we could be confident of hitting the deadline.</p>

These all contribute to achieving cashflow targets and, pleasingly, we exceeded our Parts &amp; Service budget for the month which certainly helps in a quiet market.</p>
                        <p>“This achievement is only possible thanks to the hard work of everyone right across the Aftersales team, from mechanics, parts, admin, warranty and service.  Everyone chipped in and knew what they had to do, the fact we got into it early also meant we were well positioned to meet our deadline consideration.</p>
                        <p>“Joe was thrilled with how the Aftersales team across TDX and LDX got into the task early, which meant we ended up in an extremely strong position running into the close-off for the end of financial year, and while the overall market is extremely tough at the moment and our overall company sales are well back it was great that the Aftersales team could deliver a positive result to help pull us through.”</p>
                        <p>On the LDX side of the business, the EOFY was also handled with professionalism and dedication.</p>
                        <p>“The EOFY is always a major event on the calendar, it looms up large and is almost like being a sports team working through a season then coming up to a big Grand Final,” said Joe Gradwell, General Manager - Aftersales Operations, Christchurch.</p>

I am absolutely thrilled with how the team equipped themselves to handle the challenge, they pulled together and achieved some outstanding results - it's fair to say that they came out the winner on the day, so well done to everyone involved.</p>

                        <p>“From a wider business perspective, we should rightfully reflect on our achievements over the past 12-months and celebrate our successes, specifically setting up a new company, recruiting a full complement of staff, and especially winning the Fonterra business.  </p>
                        <p>“The Fonterra account is a significant milestone in the young LDX company, and certainly helps LDX cement its place in the market given the largest company in New Zealand puts its trust and confidence into LDX to support its material handling needs and this was only made possible through tireless work by multiple people, all of whom went above and beyond to secure the business.  Their efforts have helped ensure the Fonterra start-up has been a success, so I would like to express a special thank you to all involved for pulling this off.</p>
                        <p>“With regards to the EOFY, I'd like to publicly acknowledge the fine work by Craig and our TDX team as well as the LDX team, both personally and from the Board and Directors.</p>
                        <p>“It's a tough market out there and Aftersales performance is critical from a cashflow perspective, the commitment and dedication from our Aftersales teams has ensured a strong finish to the EOFY.</p>
                        <p>“Thankfully, it looks like there might be some light at the end of what has been a very long tunnel over recent quarters and, while our overall business won't recover overnight, there are signs that things will be more positive than what we have experienced over this last year.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>“Thanks to the excellent work of the team, TDX and LDX are in a great position to maximise future growth opportunities.”</h5>

                        <h1 class="">Hero Staff Member:<br>Phil Smith</h1>
                        <br>
                        
                        <h6>his month's Hero a Staff Member is Phil Smith, who is based at the TDX Auckland branch and is the Upper North Island Regional Ops Manager.
                        <br><br>
                        Phil is responsible for Aftersales elements in our biggest and busiest region including parts, service and warranty and looks after a lot of significant clients and the many diverse customers at these businesses.
                        <br><br> 
                        Joe Gradwell and then Craig Wymer were asked to speak about Phil, here's what they had to say.
                        </h6>
                        
                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        <br>

                        <p>Phil has been with TDX coming up one year, he came into the role with lots of industry experience having worked for other OEM's, he's made a great first-up impression.</p>
                        <p>He's one of those guys who is calm and collected under pressure, it's fair to say he's a real people-person - and that stands him in good stead from both a TDX and customer perspective.  He provides great leadership to the team through being calm and approachable, and is also highly skilled dealing with some of our large and 'business critical' clients, including liaising with the sheer volume of customers.</p>
                        <p>One of Phil's strengths is how he adapts to others.  He has an 'open door' approach, he is willing to address issues proactively and deal with small problems before they become big ones.  If issues pop up, his cool head means he takes time to analyse a problem, then find and implement a solution.</p>
                        <p>It's Phil's leadership which helps create a positive team culture and empowers those around him to be part of a solution.  Whilst he is often involved with sorting a big problem at the main pressure point, he has a highly capable team which helps deliver outstanding results and provides our customer peace of mind. </p>
                        <p> And it's vital to TDX that the region is firing on all cylinders, there are a number of big accounts in and around Auckland and it's a reflection on our business how we front up and support the partnership we have with these customers.</p>
                        <p>I know Phil is only just getting started, he's building a good team around him and they are doing a very good job so far.  I'm impressed and excited about the future for the upper north region.</p>

                       <h6>We'll now hear from Craig…</h6>
                       

                       <p>I would like to reemphasise what Joe has said already, that Phil has made a solid and very commendable start at TDX.</p>
                       <p>It's no easy feat dealing with a region as big and diverse as the Upper North.  A key consideration relating to the size of the region is that customers have a lot of different choices, they have numerous options of what machines to source and from where.  It means that relationships are key, and Phil is at the forefront leading these from an Aftersales perspective and helping to secure ongoing business from these customers.</p>
                       <p>This is where one of his strengths shows through, his ability to be adaptable and relate to different customers.  He's got a great nature, is balanced and considered and has clear and precise thinking about problems and how to address them.</p>
                       <p>Even though he's only been part of the TDX team since August, we're seeing positive changes from his interactions with customers as well as across other departments within the business itself.</p>
                       <p>He not only has our TDX values front of mind, but is delivering a world-class experience for our customers combined with local know-how.</p>
                       
                       
                     

                       <br>

                       <h5>Keep up the good work, Phil - many thanks for your efforts, they are much appreciated!</h5>
