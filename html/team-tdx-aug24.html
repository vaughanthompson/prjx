                        <br>

                        <h6>This issue of the TDX Newsletter starts with a safety message from our Chairman of the Board, Greg Campbell.</h6>
                        <br>

                       
                        
                        <p>Over my career as a CEO and Director in many different industry sectors, I've had the
                            unfortunate duty of facing families, friends and colleagues of employees who have lost their
                            lives or been severely injured while on the job. These tragic incidents leave a lasting impact
                            - an immediate void in the lives of loved ones and a long-term loss for our community. In
                            every instance, these losses were avoidable. They often stemmed from staff attempting to
                            help by taking on tasks beyond the initial scope, underestimating the risks involved.</p>

                        <p>One of the hardest things I've ever had to do is stand before a grieving family and trying to
                            offer some semblance of comfort, knowing that their loss could have been prevented. These
                            experiences have taught me that we must never assume, “It won't happen here”, or “It won't
                            happen to us”. Safety should always be our top priority.</p>

                            <p>As you go about your work, I urge you to look after yourself and your colleagues, you
                                wouldn't live with yourself if you saw a colleague undertaking a task with uncontrolled risk
                                and you never spoke up. If at any point for any reason you feel uncomfortable or unsure
                                about a task, speak up. Ask yourself this critical question; Would I be comfortable with my
                                most loved one doing this task as I am? If the answer is no, then it is time to stop and
                                reassess.</p>

                            <h6 class="brandColor">Take care out there. Let's ensure that everyone goes home safely at the end of each day.</h6>

                        <br>

                        <h6>A new chapter for the Volvo brand started two years ago with a new name in New Zealand:
                            TDX.</h6><br>


                        <p>Despite a challenging environment and aggression from the competition since the end of COVID, the performance of the TDX team has been nothing short of outstanding.</p>

                        <p>We continue to see an incredible dedication to the Volvo brand in New Zealand. A highlight for me includes increasing our market share in all segments, which includes doubling our share in excavators. This has historically been our biggest challenge.</p>

                        <p>Another highlight has to be the delivery of the two 100T rigid dumptrucks, the first two sold for the last 15 years in Oceania.</p>

                        <p>What can I say about the Quarry conference. What an amazing event! Close to 500 guests during the Volvo TDX dinner and a lot of interest from the customers in new solutions such as productivity services and electromobility.</p>

                        <p>Leading Electromobility is a top priority on our agenda and we can see that TDX have the right mindset and is already putting the right actions in place.</p>

                        <p>Phil Bracefield, General Manager - Supply Chain (pictured), is the person charged with
                            overseeing the process, while Dean McKenzie, National Warehouse &amp; Logistics
                            Manager, looks after the implementation side. Starting with Phil, this story looks into

                        <p>“We've been looking at ways to enhance the supply chain process, as this ultimately benefits our customers and the experience they have with TDX.</p> 
       

                        <p>“Over the past 10 months we have been focusing on the resources, the capability and also the processes, with my main focus on where we can make improvements to deliver an even better experience.</p> 


                          <p>“We benchmarked existing processes against best practice as it's important to know where our baseline performance is at, to help focus our goal of providing a world-class experience.</p>

                        were fortunate to bring Dean into the business as National Warehouse Logistics Manager.</p>

                        brands, so it's on us to maintain the quality and standing of these brands, delivering the
                        expected level of service at the right cost.</p>

                        <p>“We need to ensure there are replacement parts in stock and that they are readily available,
                        so a good understanding of the supply chain is vital.</p>
                   
                        <p>“There are a number of challenges associated with this, such as the geography of the
                        country as well as the stretch of water between the two islands. These factors can make
                        getting parts out to all 18 branches difficult, but it's important to get it right to help maintain
                        trust, credibility and reputation of TDX and the brands we represent.</p>

                        <p>“Another unique set of challenges is the size and variations of parts and consumables we
                        carry, as well as significant lead times associated with sourcing items from offshore -
                        whether they are roll on-roll off arrivals, container loads of equipment or fast moving
                        consumer goods like Shell Oil products. We cater to a really diverse and interesting range of

                        <br> 

                        <p>The National Quarry Conference is considered one of the most prestigious annual events in the country. This year it was held in Rotorua in mid-July and TDX was there, together with Shell and Volvo CE.</p>
                        

                        <p>Having a presence at the event is important, as it demonstrates that TDX is serious about supporting those who support us. It's also a great way for us to connect with new and existing customers.</p>

                        <p>A highlight of day one, was James O&#39;Connor giving an overview of the EC500 which forms part of the new series of Volvo Excavators which we are launching this year. He also gave an overview of the Volvo Electric JL120 pilot loader which has been in test with FH from late last year. A video of James giving an overview on each machine can be viewed below:</p>

                        Manager, Fulton Hogan gave a keynote talk about Volvo's Electric machine ambitions and
                        about how the JL120 pilot has gone so far from FH's perspective.</p>
                        <p>The conference finished on Friday night with the TDX/Volvo awards night, which recognises

                        <p>A standout from the night was Nigel's award, this is outstanding recognition of his efforts
                        dealing with people and the support he's giving the industry. He's done a monumental job
                        and thoroughly deserves the accolade.</p>

                        <h2>The Yanmar 35-7 Launch</h2>

                        <p>There's nothing like a new model launch to get people to sit/ up and take interest! For the
                        first time in six years, Yanmar had a new machine to showcase.</p>
                        <p>The TDX team launched the all-new Yanmar 35-7 and 30-7 excavator range on July 25 at an
                        event in Auckland.</p>         
                        <p>50 Yanmar customers were invited to the event and were well impressed by the new model.
                        The new 35-7 was on display for customers to explore, while all customers also received
                        merchandise, information packs and exclusive pricing for the current range of Yanmar
                        machines.</p>
                        <p>Feedback from the customers was very positive, so much so that a few deals were done on
                        the night and a couple more the next day, with the anticipation of a lot more enquiry.</p>
                        <p>One thing that was evident on the night is that Yanmar has a strong following in New
                        Zealand. All customers spoke highly of the brand and the performance of the machines,
                        especially their reliability, and also the positive relationship they have with the TDX team.</p>
                        <p>As more machines land over the coming months, the marketing team will continue to push
                        the 35-7. The next opportunity to feature it is at the Civil Contractors Conference which is
                        on this month in Invercargill, as well as in a series of print and digital advertising campaigns.</p>

                            Hitting late on a Friday afternoon at a time when people start thinking about their
                            weekends, our IT team swung into action to avert the impending catastrophe. Here's
                            some information about the great work the team did to manage the situation.<br><br>
                            What is CrowdStrike and what's this all about?</h6>

                        <p>CrowdStrike is an American cybersecurity technology company that provides cloud-based
                            security solutions for various platforms. It also manages and responds to threats as well as
                            provides cyber attack response services.</p>
                        
                        <p>On Friday July 19, a bug in CrowdStrike's cloud-based testing system - specifically, the part
                            that runs validation checks on new updates prior to release - ended up allowing the software
                            to be pushed out despite containing 'problematic content data.'</p>

                        <p>In short, the global IT outage came down to a single software update. The update to the Falcon sensor programme, run by CrowdStrike, caused a coding error that sent millions of Windows computers worldwide to a 'Blue Screen of Death.'</p>

                        <p>The outage affected numerous Windows PC and computer systems worldwide, effectively shutting down many businesses and causing hundreds of millions of dollars of losses globally.</p>

                        <h6 class="brandColor">What happened at TDX?</h6> 

                        <p>TDX first began to experience the issue at 5pm when multiple alerts were received when all 33 production servers started to reboot.</p>

                        <h6 class="brandColor">Impact</h6> 
                        
                        <p>To resolve the reboot issue, the decision was made to remove the Falcon sensors from our production servers. This was to prevent damage to the underlying operating system from multiple crashes and to ensure the environment was operational for Saturday trading.</p>

                        <p>CrowdStrike released an update file to resolve the issue at 5.27pm but, by this time, TDX IT
                        had resolved the reboot issue on 80% of the production servers. IT continued to monitor CrowdStrike updates in case there were any other issues introduced through the correct file update.</p>

                        <h6 class="brandColor">Resolution</h6> 
                        
                        <p>No tickets were raised from the network during Saturday trading indicating the actions taken Friday evening minimised the impact on TDX operations.</p>
                        <p>On Sunday, the Falcon sensor agent was re-installed on all production servers. The servers were monitored to ensure no issues occurred.</p>

                        <h6 class="brandColor">Final Outcome</h6> 
                        
                        <p>A communication was sent to all TDX staff providing an update on the weekend's events and providing instructions on the steps required if their local device experienced the Blue Screen issue. Only 11 users reported issues with their local device, of which 10 have been remediated with one outstanding.</p>

                        <h5>We should recognise the outstanding effort the IT team went to managing this issue and also the extra work they did ensuring systems and processes continued to run smoothly during this difficult time, great work by everyone involved!</h5>

                            hard at work in and around the Nelson area in his role as a Field Service Technician.</h6>
                        <h6>We spoke with Scott Moodie who gave us a bit of a glimpse into Nigel and his work as
                            part of this month's Hero a Staff Member section.</h6>
                        <br>

                        <br>

                        <p>Nigel has been with TDX three and a half years, he's really excelled as a Field Service technician. His official base is Nelson, but in reality, he could be out and about throughout the upper South Island.</p>

                        <p>Most recently, he's been doing two week shifts at the Stockton Mine. He jumped at the chance to be involved and has used it as a real learning experience, expanding his knowledge and expertise around mining equipment.</p>

                        <p>He's skilled at what he does - he's efficient , loves getting the job done and doesn't mind getting his hands dirty. He's also more often than not the first to put his hand up when a new challenge presents itself whether this be Whalewatch Vessels in Kaikoura or Power generation for off grid properties in the Motueka Valley.</p>

                        
                        <p>Nigel originally qualified in Heavy Road Transport but after starting with TDX he took the
                       opportunity to work towards the NZ Certificate of Automotive Engineering Plant and
                       Equipment which he achieved recently. This was a great achievement and shows his
                       commitment to our industry.</p>

                        <p>This recent qualification demonstrates he has the skills and knowledge to further himself at
                       TDX, he's also a real team player and instils his work ethics in our apprentices.
                       He has TDX values at the heart of everything he does, especially when it comes to putting
                       the customer first.</p>
