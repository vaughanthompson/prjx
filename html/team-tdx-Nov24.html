                        <br>

                        <h6>This month's introduction is about workplace drug testing, which is an important policy as it relates directly to safety of us and our team members.</h6>
                        <br>

                        <p>TDX has a duty of care to look after our employees and one element of that is ensuring people aren't affected by harmful substances when doing their job, which could then impact on the safety of others around them.</p>
                            
                        <p>Alle McGrath, General Manager - People and Safety, chats about the importance of this policy and outlines some of the recent changes.</p>

                        <p>Earlier this year we consulted with you on some changes to our drug and alcohol policy.  We did this to ensure we had a modern and up to date policy, that added value to the business, and also to ensure we were meeting our obligations under the safety legislation.</p>
                        
                        <p>One of the key changes we made was around the 'how' we completed random drug testing.  Historically we had sent a list of employees to The Drug Detection Agency, who then randomly selected a certain number of employees around the country to complete testing.</p>

                    <section>             
                        <p>We found that some of the same people were continually being tested (because of the random selection process) and of course that also meant some employees would go years without ever having their name selected. To ensure a fair and transparent process, we have changed our approach to random testing and our new system went live in October.  </p>  

                        <p>To get the new procedure underway, I visited the Dunedin Site with a bucket of red and green sticks.  Each employee on site selects a stick from the bucket - if they select a green stick then they carry on with their day and if they select a red stick then they proceed to the van for testing.  I am very pleased to say that of the four tests we did, all had a clean pass rate.  Awesome work Team Dunedin!!!!</p>  

                        <p>Why do we do random testing?  Being at work while impaired by drugs or alcohol is a significant risk to the individual and to those working around you.  Random testing is one of the controls we have in place to ensure we do not have impaired employees in our workplace.</p>  

                        <h6 class="brandColor">Random testing is not about catching people out, it's a deterrent and a control measure to ensure our workplaces are as safe as they can be.</h6>

                        <p>One of the other changes we made to the policy was around medicinal cannabis.  We understand that there are many different ways of treating pain or illnesses such as anxiety or other disorders.  Only you will know the best path to take when it comes to treatment.  </p>

                        <p>What is important though, is that you tell us so that we can work together to understand any impairment challenges that we need to consider and address.</p>

                        <p>If you think that you may have an issue passing a drug and alcohol test, please reach out to either your manager, Jess or myself.</p>

                        <p>We are not here to judge you, we are here to help.  If you are committed to doing the work that might be required to pass a drug and alcohol screen, then we will help you. </p>

                        <p>Don't be afraid that you will lose your job for coming forward and being proactive to sort any issues of this kind.  Leaving it to chance is not a good strategy.</p>

                        <br>
                        <h6>If it's got a diesel engine, then TDX has the right people for the job.  While a lot of our work relates to machines in the field and operating on the ground, the team in Whangarei/Auckland have been working on a project that's almost 200-feet long and can carry up to 55 people.</h6>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h6>Phil Oakley, TDX Service Manager in Whangarei, tells us about what they've been spending their time on…</h6>
                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>Catalano Shipping Services operate an exploration vessel for a variety of maritime purposes, ranging from launching submarines and deep sea exploration, retrieving aircraft black boxes and even filming giant squid.</p>  

                        <p>The boat is powered by three large Detroit Series 60 engines, with generator sets bolted onto the back of the engines which supply reliable power to the ship for running all the electricals and other operational equipment.</p>  

                        <h6 class="brandColor">Our involvement started in November 2023 when we were asked to price up a job to rebuild the three S60 Detroit engines.  However, once we got into the boat, it became clear there was a lot more work involved rather than just refurbing the genset engines.</h6>  

                        <br>


                        <p>The condition of the engines wasn't flash, servicing requirements hadn't been followed and the wrong fluids and lubricants were helping the situation.  They needed a full overhaul, as well as an entirely new block for two of them.</p>

                        

                        <p>There aren't many Detroit Series 60 blocks just lying around, so we put a call out to find two.  That's one of the beauties of the TDX network, we were able to find used blocks then we machined it to spec and back to standard specification.</p>
                        
                        <br>

                        <br>

                        <p>The next challenge was getting all the parts back into the boat.  With the vessel being up on the hard, the team working on it have a 40m walk up and onto the boat, before descending down inside it.  We needed to use a crane to lift the parts up onto and into the boat, then into the hull for reassembly.</p>

                        <p>It's definitely been one of the most difficult jobs I've encountered, but the customer is really happy with our work and the boat is leaving Whangarei in much better condition than it arrived in.</p>

                        <h6 class="brandColor">I'd like to recognise the team involved, it's taken considerable outside the square thinking to make things happen, right through to the team looking after invoicing as that's been a constantly evolving task with unexpected and added work around every corner.</h6>

Blackhead Quarries are long standing customers of TDX, so we thought it appropriate to have a chat with Tony before he parks up his digger one last time...</h6>

                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        <br>
                        
                        <p class="brandColor"><em>Tony, congratulations on your upcoming retirement and thanks for taking the time to have a chat with us - can you tell us a little bit about yourself.
                        </em></p>
                        <p>The original quarry was started in 1880 by my great great grandfather, so I'm the fifth generation of our family to be involved in the industry - you could say I've been brought up in it and I have worked here all my life.</p>
                        <p>We've had an association with TDX for the past 20-years or so, mainly with Volvo equipment but also some Yanmar machinery.</p>
                       
                        
                        <p class="brandColor"><em>Looking back over your career, what have been some of the standout highlights or most memorable moments in the quarry industry?</em></p>
                        <p>It's not so much about moments, it's about evolution and new ideas.</p>
                        <p>One of the things I've tried to do is innovation, bringing new technology into the business as soon as we can.</p>
                        <p>We have always tried to be one step ahead of the competition and to adopt international best practice as early as possible.</p>
                        <p>I am passionate about bringing the next generation into the industry and training them to be the best they can be.  I take great pride in seeing people I have trained doing well and contributing to the industry.</p>
                        

                        <p class="brandColor"><em>How has the quarry industry evolved since you first started, and what are some of the most significant changes you've seen over the years?</em></p>
                        <p>The key change is the evolution around equipment and how this has translated into how our people interact with their machines.  They now have far less time in the field and are now predominantly in the cab.</p>
                        <p>Instead of being out in the weather, most of the time our guys are in a high quality air conditioned cab, they are feeling good and are able to focus on the job at hand.</p>                        
                        <p>Not exposing people to risk is key to the job today and Volvo is a leader in this space.  When they're in a good environment they make good decisions.</p>

                        
                        <p class="brandColor"><em>As you prepare to retire, what do you consider the most important qualities or values in a business partnership, particularly in your long-standing relationship with TDX?</em></p>
                        <p>As a general philosophy, partnerships are the key to doing business - irrespective of whether it's with suppliers or customers.</p>
                        <p>From a TDX perspective, the quality of service we receive is very good, which is why TDX is strong in our business.</p>                        
                        <p>Machines need regular servicing, so being able to control service timings enables us to manage our business better, which is incredibly important. </p>

                        <p class="brandColor"><em>What are the most important factors you consider when selecting equipment for your quarries, and how has TDX helped meet those needs?</em></p>
                        <p>It is all about service, that's what keeps our business running, without service everything stops.  There are probably a dozen different machines you could buy to do a job, then about four or five that would be at the top of the list, but only a couple which offer decent service at the back end.  And these are the machines or suppliers we do business with.</p>


                        <p class="brandColor"><em>In your experience, how has quarry equipment, especially heavy machinery, evolved during your time in the industry?</em></p>
                        <p>Fit for purpose is the most important, it also comes down to operator comfort and safety.  Cabs these days offer great working environments, they have air conditioning and bluetooth, happy people are better and more productive.  There have of course been advancements in technology and fuel efficiency, but operator comfort is a massive consideration.</p>


                        <p class="brandColor"><em>What are your thoughts on Volvo equipment, and how has it impacted the efficiency, safety, or sustainability of your operations? </em></p>
                        <p>Volvo is right up there when it comes to key considerations for our business and our operators, including cab conditions as well as the all-important servicing.</p>

                        <p class="brandColor"><em>What advice would you give to someone starting out in the quarry industry today, especially in terms of navigating changes in technology and equipment?</em></p>
                        <p>Working in the quarry industry is a great opportunity.  I've certainly loved my time, it's like playing in the sand pit every day, just using bigger toys than most.</p>

                        <p>The LDX Fonterra agreement was a piece of work six months in the making involving a team of eight.</p>
                        
                        <p>There were numerous rounds of discussions with Fonterra, we needed to understand their business as well as their needs and requirements, specifically around fleet management and service needs across the country.</p>

                        <p>Some of the requirements included certainty around parts and inventory and also ensuring we have LDX technicians in regions to help manage fleet requirements.</p>

                        <p>It's all about minimising downtime and providing reassurance to Fonterra that we're able to deliver on our commitments as part of the agreement.

We enjoy a partnership based on trust and understanding, with open dialogue as key.</p>

                        <p>From a customer perspective, Fonterra knows we have the capability and expertise to meet their requirements.  They also have extra peace of mind knowing LMH AU is able to offer support and back up, both from the factory and technical standpoint.</p>
                        
                        <p>Being awarded this account was a huge accomplishment by the LDX team and is a massive feather in our cap as we continue to grow the business - especially when you consider LDX has been in existence for less than a year.</p>                        
                        
                        <p>This partnership is a fantastic opportunity for LDX to demonstrate itself as a service provider which is more than capable of delivering to one of NZ's biggest companies.</p>
                        
                        <h6 class="brandColor">A lot of people have put in a lot of effort, so much so that Fonterra has confidence in our business to deliver what they need.  I am also confident this will lead to other opportunities for LDX and our amazing team.</h6>

                        <br>
                        
                        <h6>Laura Velasquez Sanchez moved from the Dominican Republic to Christchurch about three years ago and her first job in New Zealand was at TDX Head Office.</h6>
                        <br>

                        <h6>Since then, she has established herself as a key member of the Warranty team, so much so that in recent months she has stepped up and taken on extra responsibilities following the return of Andrew Wiley to his home in Scotland.</h6>
                        <br>

                        <h6>We had a chat with Joe Gradwell to find out a bit more about why Laura has been recognised as this month's Hero a Staff Member.</h6>
                        <br>

                        <p>When Laura started at TDX her job was to manage connected services and oversee machine connectivity and telematics.  She has really excelled in this role and is an absolute star, displaying core TDX values such as innovation and - perhaps most importantly - customers.</p>

                        <p>When Andrew Wiley left about three months ago, we could have easily found ourselves in a bit of a pickle.  Thankfully, due to Laura's TDX mindset and teamwork-focused approach, she stepped up and into his role.</p>

                        <p>Her key vision is one of keeping customers going at all times and her efforts have ensured their warranty claims are processed in a timely manner.</p>

                        <p>She's taken on a big job and is proving herself to be a master dealing with partners and liaising with branches and teams  as they work through warranty jobs.</p>
                        
                       <p>She's doing an absolutely stellar job keeping everything moving and ensuring our customers are well looked after.</p>

                       <p>Laura continues to step up and lead by example in a tough market, making sure we're doing our best to not let anyone down.</p>

                       <p>I'd like to personally acknowledge her outstanding efforts and thank her for stepping up and getting the job done in what could have been a challenging situation.</p>
