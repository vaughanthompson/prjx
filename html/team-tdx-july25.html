                        <br>

                        <h6>Phillip Bracefield joined TDX in November 2023, originally as GM of Supply Chain and now GM Operations.  This month's intro from Phillip touches on priorities for his new role, as well as an update about freight recovery.</h6>

                        <br>

                        <p>I'm a bit of a movie buff, one of my favourites is 'Any Given Sunday,' specifically the Locker Room talk that Al Pacino delivers to his team.</p>

                        <p>This is an iconic scene as he underlines the importance of team work and achieving small gains, all which make the difference between winning and losing.</p>

                        <p>If you have a few minutes spare, click through and watch the clip - it will help you understand what I'm talking about:</p>

                        <p>What Al says to his team is equally applicable to what we do at TDX, it's a business where winning inches are important as, ultimately, they contribute to our bottom line.</p>

                        <h6 class="brandColor">The newly created role of GM Operations sees me retain oversight of the Supply Chain, but now also the Aftersales Team.</h6>
                        <br>

                        <p>My role is to support Craig and the aftersales team on issues and challenges with a focus on operational efficiency.</p>                    
                        <p>A big motivator for me when identifying efficiencies and opportunities is constantly asking the question - why.  Why do we do something this way?  What can we do differently?  Is there a new system or process we can develop and implement to help make things better, faster, safer or more efficient?</p>
                        <p>It's not about shaking the tree and making massive changes, it's tweaks and improvements - small gains which add up to something significant, the difference between winning and losing!</p>
                        <p>And it's about the team, about all of us following systems, as that way we can understand a situation and what's expected of us during a particular process.</p>
                        <p>So let's continue to ask the question 'why,' continue to innovate and implement, and make every action something which contributes to us winning those vital inches.</p>

                        <h5>TDX is an outstanding team and, with process efficiencies, can achieve even greater results.</h5>

                        <br>
                         
                        
                        <p>One business improvement process we're been working on as a team is our freight recovery.  The amount of product we're sending out from our branches to customers is increasing month on month and with this comes considerable expense. </p>
                        <p>We have reconsidered our approach to freight, specifically how we charge customers.  Rather than have different rates for every shipment we have moved to  standardised rates.  This offers customers consistency and, whilst there are invariably some 'overs and unders,' it balances out over the year.</p>
                        <p>The goal  isn't to recover freight on every transaction, especially as we offer some freight free thresholds, but rather introduce a process which standardises the system  that delivers consistency.</p>
                        <p>I'm pleased to say we're seeing some results in the space.  For example, the volume of unrecovered freight for the previous 12-months was potentially $280K.  Since implementing the new process almost six-months ago, this amount has decreased to less than $150K.</p>
                        <p>This is a great example of asking the 'why' question then implementing a new process to help make a real difference to the business.</p>
                        <p>I'd like to acknowledge everyone involved in making this change, it's been a great team effort and we've made fantastic gains in this space and making those inches count - keep up the awesome work!</p>

                        <br>
                        Tim Heyworth is the company's Health and Safety Advisor.  Based at Head Office in Christchurch, he is responsible for H&S activities at all 17 TDX sites around the country.

                        <p>Tim's experience comes from H&S initiatives in the private sector, then most recently nine-years as a regulator at WorkSafe and he has almost chalked up his first year at TDX.</p>

                        <p>The TDX 'Take 5' process has been given some recent tweaks and improvements, so we thought it a good time to check in with Tim and find out about the updates.</p>

                        <h5>What is Take 5?</h5>
                        <ul class="bulleted vanilla">
                            <li>Take 5 is a circuit breaker between when you get to a job, and when you start work on that job to create a deliberate pause to think about what might hurt you and others.<br><br></li>
                            <li>There is a misconception that Take 5 means taking 5 minutes to assess risk. Depending upon the format, a Take 5 could take 30 seconds to visually assess immediate risk before exiting your vehicle, or it could be a more formal documented process that takes a bit longer prior to working on a piece of machinery.<br><br></li>
                            <li>The “5” bit of Take 5 pertains to the 5 steps involved in the process, being - Stop, Look, Assess, Control (the risk), and Proceed (incl. monitor identified hazards).<br><br></li>
                            <li>TDX uses an app on work issued phones where Tech's can access a Take 5 form, fill it in, and submit it while onsite immediately prior to beginning work on a given task/case I.D. This captures information to identify the people doing the task, what the task is and its related case I.D, then it provides prompts for areas to consider such as whether a critical risk is present (driving vehicles, mobile plant/traffic, lifting operations, release of energy, falling from height, falling objects, exposure to hazardous substances), and to get the Tech's thinking about how to control identified risk to keep themselves and others safe.<br><br>

                       <br>
                       <br></li>
                            <li>Take 5 is sometimes perceived to be “extra work”, and this can in some instances create a negative perception around it. Take 5 is an expected part of each job task and is factored in to task planning. It should be used as intended to take time to assess risk and implement controls to keep people safe.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Why do we do Take 5?</h5>
                        <ul class="bulleted vanilla">
                            <li>To keep people safe by identifying hazards and managing risk.<br><br></li>
                            <li>Expectation under HSWA (Health and Safety at Work Act 2015) to identify hazards and manage risk.<br><br></li>
                            <li>Requirement from some client sites to document risk assessment prior to starting work on their site(s).<br><br></li>
                            <li>Evidence for pre-qualification audits.<br><br></li>
                            <li>As a lead indicator for risk management and compliance reporting. More Take 5s done should reduce the number of reported incidents as risk is being identified and mitigated.</li>
                        </ul>


                        <br>

                        <h5>What changes have been made to the Take 5 form/process?</h5>
                        <p>Feedback was received from Techs that some parts of the process were repetitive and/or could benefit from being streamlined. It is recognised that if you make a person's job easier/faster, you're likely to get better buy-in. With this in mind, the following changes were made to the TDX version of the Take 5 app (an LDX Take 5 process is currently in development).</p>
                        <ul class="bulleted vanilla">
                            <li>Previously, if more than one Tech was working on the same task, each Tech had to submit a Take 5. This created duplication, and risked having each Tech identify different risks without communicating them to others. Now multiple Tech's can be added to the same Take 5 submission, promoting discussion between all those involved and reducing duplication. Tech names can now be selected via a drop-down menu window.<br><br></li>
                            <li>Previously, if you were on a customer site and had 3 case I.Ds for 3 jobs, but they were substantively the same task (3 services on the same type of machine for example), you'd have to fill out a separate Take 5 for each of the 3 case IDs. Now you can add multiple case I.Ds to the same Take 5 submission if the tasks are similar.<br><br></li>
                            <li>Previously, Tech's had to manually type in free text boxes to add information that was already captured elsewhere, such as “What is the task”, which was already identified on the case paperwork. This sort of duplication was removed. Free input boxes have been reduced.<br><br></li>
                            <li>An automated escalation function has been added to the Take 5 app. Following on-screen prompts, if certain selections are made that indicate outstanding risk remains that cannot be easily resolved, the app will trigger an escalation process that notifies the Tech's Supervisor/Manager and begins a 10-minute timer for the Manager to contact the Tech to figure out a way to address the identified risk. If the Manager hasn't acknowledged the notification within 10 minutes, the app will automatically notify the next Manager up the chain. This escalation process continues every 10 minutes until someone acknowledges the alert and deals with it.</li>
                        </ul>

                        I've been at TDX coming up six years and I'm based in Auckland.  I am the Yanmar Territory Manager for Auckland and Northland.</p>

                        I know our competitors' product very, very well - perhaps even better than some of their own sales people.  Key to success is being able to demonstrate that our machines can outperform a competitor product, especially when it's one a customer is considering.</p>

                        <p>Also knowing what a customer is doing, what they intend using the machine for, is critically important - offering something which is fit for purpose, exceeds in product comparisons and is the right machine for the job.</p>

                        <p>It boils down to asking lots of questions and following up, essentially understanding their business and requirements, as well as where we stand against competitors.</p>

                        <p><strong class="green">What was the biggest challenge securing the record sales?</strong><br>
                        A key for me is all about the communication with the customer.  It's knowing when to push and when to pull back.  It's important to stay close to a prospective customer and the deal, maintain good and open communication - but without becoming annoying.</p>

                            <p><strong class="green">What were you most proud about?</strong><br>
                        For me, there was considerable thought and effort put into winning the deals.  We were never the cheapest. I also lost a few deals initially but managed to find some key info to swing them back to TDX. If I had accepted those losses, half that number would not be here.</p>

                            <p><strong class="green">How did the wider TDX team support you?</strong><br>
                        I always receive great assistance from Finance - Adam Mottram - and also support from my boss - Richard Papps.  Now that the deals are done, the pressure is on the workshop team at Hautapu to get the machines out when required.  I have every confidence they will deliver, as they have pushed out a lot of the machines this month already.</p>

                        <p><strong class="green">Do you have any tips for success for aspiring sales people?</strong><br>
                        Sure, a couple of key things are that if something doesn't make sense, then ask the question.  Also seek clarification, ask the questions that need to be asked, and if you don't know, then say you don't, but that you will find out for them. A really important one to finish is to always leave a conversation knowing something you didn't know before - don't just ring up and ask if they have made a decision, think of a way to find out more information or details from a customer which can help get your own deal across the line.  It's always worth fighting for a deal right up to the bitter end.</p>

                        <p>You have two ears and only one mouth for a reason.  Listen twice as much as you talk.</p>

                        <p><strong class="green">So what comes next after your massive week, are you aiming for $2.3M?</strong><br>
                        It was a fantastic achievement, a really cool week to be a part of, but as soon as the week is over the focus moves to what's next.  It's all about looking for new customers and opportunities, hitting a big number would be great but first and foremost is looking after existing customers and then chasing new clients.  But records are made to be broken, so let's see what the future holds.</p>

                        <h6>In this month's Hero a Staff Member, we speak with Phillip Bracefield about July McQueen, someone who is often going above and beyond helping the wider TDX team.</h6>

                        <p>July rejoined TDX in February 2022 and is now the Manager of the Supply Chain Operations Administration team, a role which has grown considerably over the last 12-months.</p>
                       <p>She leads a skilled and efficient team, one which adds real value and support to the business.</p>
                       <p>She plays a formidable role in supporting both the front and back lines of TDX and is the 'joiner' between the Sales functions.</p>
                       <p>Her team looks after different business units including equipment, power products division, international freight as well as the admin for all shipments moving into the country.</p>
                       <p>A key responsibility of July's job is supply and presentation of business critical reports with real time insights, all of which help us make better informed business decisions.</p>

                       <p>July has a very tenacious attitude, an eye for detail and is very process orientated.  She is someone who will challenge the status quo, all the while looking for process leakage or waste.</p>

                        <p>She is very organised, gets involved in numerous projects throughout the year - whether leading or facilitating - and is very good at finding 'the answer' to a particular problem or situation.</p>
                       <p>This passion for improvement and efficiencies result in delivery of significant contributions to the enhancement of day to day operations.</p>
